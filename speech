[Slide 1: Title Slide]

Good [morning/afternoon], respected faculty, fellow students, and esteemed guests.

I am Y. Bhanu Sai from Batch 6, and I, along with my teammates G. Nanda Kishore, G. Bhaskar, and K. Akash, am honored to present our project titled “Image to Sketch Application using AI.” This work was completed under the valuable guidance of M. Prasad Rao Sir, and is an initiative from the Department of Computer Engineering at Kallam Haranadha Reddy Institute of Technology.

[Slide 2: Abstract]

Let me begin with a brief abstract of our project.

This application is a user-friendly tool designed to transform regular photos into pencil sketch-style images. By using Python and OpenCV, we apply a combination of basic image processing techniques like grayscale conversion, inversion, Gaussian blur, and blending.

The goal is to give the image a hand-drawn, artistic sketch effect. It’s lightweight, fast, and serves a wide range of use cases — from digital art creation to educational tools and engaging social media content.


---

[Slide 3: Benefits]

Now, let's look at the benefits of our application.

First, it’s very easy to use — no editing skills are needed. Just upload an image and get the result.

It saves time by instantly converting photos into sketches.

The output looks realistic, as if sketched by hand.

It’s fun and creative, perfect for art lovers or casual users.

It serves as a free alternative to costly apps or professional artists.

And finally, it’s a great tool for social media — helping users create eye-catching profile pictures and posts.

[Slide 4: Features]

Our application comes with several key features:

It converts real images into pencil-style sketches.

AI techniques are used for better quality and accuracy.

The interface is fast and simple.

Ideal for creative projects, posters, or even personal fun.

One-click sketch generation.

It also works well for social media content creation.

[Slide 5: Requirements]

Now, let me share the requirements for developing and running the application.

Hardware Requirements:

A personal computer or laptop with a modern processor, 8 GB RAM, and 256 GB SSD.


Software Requirements:

Operating Systems: Windows, Linux, or macOS

Programming: Python (latest version)

Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Streamlit, TensorFlow or PyTorch

IDEs: VS Code, PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook, or Android Studio

Package Managers: pip or conda


These tools make the application both powerful and easy to develop.

[Slide 6: Architecture]

[Briefly walk through the architecture if there is a diagram, or simply say:]

The internal workflow of the app uses Python-based image processing — beginning with image loading, then preprocessing, sketch generation, and finally displaying or downloading the output.


---

[Slide 7: Conclusion]

To conclude:

The Image to Sketch application is a simple yet powerful demonstration of how AI and image processing can come together to create artistic tools. It shows that even basic algorithms can produce impactful and fun results when applied creatively. The application is useful not only for developers but also for artists, educators, and everyday users.

[Slide 8: Future Scope]

Looking ahead, the future scope of our project is promising.

We plan to introduce multiple sketch styles like charcoal or color pencil.

Real-time sketching via the camera is a major upgrade.

A mobile version for Android and iOS will increase accessibility.

We aim to improve sketch quality with more AI training.

Editing tools like brightness, contrast, and background blur can give users more control.

And finally, features like social media sharing and offline use can greatly enhance user experience.

[Slide 9: Thank You]

Thank you all for your attention. We hope you found this project insightful and interesting. We are open to questions and feedback.
